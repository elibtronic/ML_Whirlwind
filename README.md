# Machine Learning and You: A Whirlwind Tour



In class material for the [Access 2024](https://accessconference.ca/) Workshop

Presented by:

- John Fink
- Tim Ribaric


The goal of this workshop is to introduce learners to often unexplored parts of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

## Setup

Due to the fact that working with AI models requires lots and lots of data, we'll be distributing model binaries and test data in class on USB sticks to save bandwidth
