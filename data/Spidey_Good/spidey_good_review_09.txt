I'm a big fan of Marvel so it comes as no surprise that I'd like this movie even before seeing it. But I felt it really lived up to the hype. It's ultimate fantasy. The story is really strong and as usual we get swept away into a world of impossible possibilities. 2.5 hours fly by and before you know it, you come to realise it's the final battle and soon all will be over, leaving you wanting more!

The acting is superb. The special effects are amazing and the characters all live up to their expectations. Marvel and Sony can't lose.

Don't waste time! Go see it now!
