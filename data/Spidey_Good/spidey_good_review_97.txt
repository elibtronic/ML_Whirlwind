I'll always have appreciation for soundtracks that really capture the musical tastes of a specific generation. They almost act as cultural time capsules of the time in which they were released. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse very much fits this description, featuring some of the best and most atmospheric songs of Post Malone, Juice Wrld, Seezyn, XXTentacion, Swae Lee and Annuel AE's careers. I haven't loved a soundtrack to a comic book movie this much since Spawn. Just like that film, Into The Spider-Verse's soundtrack really captures the musical atmosphere of the late 2010s. It just set such an emotional tone for the film, one that's very much earned with this excellent and moving screenplay.
