Here's the low down for those of you that don't read comics: there's more than one reality and more than one version of Spider-Man, who may not always be a man. Written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who left Solo due to creative differences, this movie is pure joy from start to finish. If you know and love the characters, it's so amazing to see them treated properly on the big screen. And if you don't, it's so much fun to meet all new versions of a character you already love.
