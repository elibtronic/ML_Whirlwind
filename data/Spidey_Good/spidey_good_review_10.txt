Where to start with this one. Quite frankly it was brilliant and amazing and had very few negatives or issues that could be taken from the movie, it is quite simply, a perfectly made superhero movie that just gives the fans and those that follow Marvel the absolute best possible experience by pushing down all the boundaries.

First off this is a must watch movie in the theatres. There is a special atmosphere that it delivers, and whilst I usually prefer people be quiet in the cinemas when watching, this movie made everyone that followed or cared about the story and universe; to scream / shout, laugh, become tearful, clap out of pure joy and relief that created an atmosphere amongst strangers that collectively connected the audience. This movie will make you feel all sorts of emotions and has a mixture of scenes that constantly pull on those emotions. The audience all react the same and whilst you don't know those people you get a sense of feeling that you are all in it together and watching this perfect piece of work unfold right in front of your eyes. It is an unreal experience and even after the movie, it is difficult to stop thinking about the movie and the experience you just had.

This is a must watch if you follow the genre, please support it so marvel just keep doing this as they absolutely nailed it. Anyone giving this a low score just does not understand a good movie or is either overly critical or simply not a fan of this genre. Alternatively, giving this movie a score of 9 or lower would mean that all other movie scores should be downgraded another 2 or 3 stars as it is extremely difficult to find another movie of this quality and amazement. It just hasn't really been done before and this movie just created history as a world first.
