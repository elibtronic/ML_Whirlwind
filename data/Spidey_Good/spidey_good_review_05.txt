Honestly, i never thought an MCU film about one superhero could ever beat how grand ENDGAME was as an Avengers movie. Obviously, No Way Home proved me wrong by being written brilliantly.

I bet getting all the old actors for spider man and their villains is an extremely tough job, not to mention making it all make sense with the storyline and where Marvel is heading in terms of stories.

But No Way Home really made everything work beautifully and I can't wait for Dr. Strange 2, especially after those post-post credit.

10/10 Fully recommend.
