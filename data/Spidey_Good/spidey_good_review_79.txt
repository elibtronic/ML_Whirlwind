"Dear Marvel fans, since I knew Spider Gwen is dubbed by my idol Hailee Steinfeld, I really wanted to watch this Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse movie. Then happily I did watch it and my review is just short: This movie is a fascinating graphic that please your eyes! Take a very big applause for artistic department and all team that make the idea of parallel universe could be combined with the original story of Spiderman. The identity, friendship, battles, family relations of Peter Parker became clear enough for the whole story of Spiderman series itself. How we ever knew about him, what is going on in his world, and when Spiderman transform himself to be a hero, is explained more here, and with the special appearances of Kingpin and his villain team, the director could lead the plots into the fun way for everybody. This is not just ordinary cartoon, but the highly qualified design graphic with the exact scenes, special effects, and bubble conversation like a moving comic-book. Every details in this animation is clearly edited by professional film-makers with any mistakes, nor any flaws. Even for Spiderman fans, this movie is so fresh to be watched and stays in his original starting point. No matter how many Spiderman movies could ever be made, this Spiderverse perhaps the first sci-fi animation I've ever watched and what a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon. And yes, I listen carefully of what Spider Gwen said because it is dubbed by my idol, Hailee Steinfeld, who will win many awards ahead. Thank you producer, director, casts, and crew to deliver this amazing movie to us."
