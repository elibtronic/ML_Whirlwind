Just like the comics, the movie brings lots of heart, fun, nostalgia, tears of joy and sadness, all the craziness that drives crowds to theaters.

A great effort that capture the essence of one of the most beloved characters of our time.

Lots of plot holes, but it is not a problem though, the script sticks to the characters brought in this adventure, to show how difficult it is to be Spider Man AND Peter Parker all at once, what is at stake when you are trying to save your neighborhood (and the world!) from bad guys while you are just a broke teenager trying to apply to college.

We truly see Peter Parker's traumas, doubts, challenges and greatness, everything that makes him so loveable and popular.

While it does not excel technically, this may be the greatest super hero story ever told.
