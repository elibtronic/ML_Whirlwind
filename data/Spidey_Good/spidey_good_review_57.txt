"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a gorgeously animated superhero film that manages to make Spider-Man feel fresh again whilst also being extremely funny and emotional. The soundtrack and the music by Daniel Pemberton are both amazing. Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Shameik Moore, Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry all give excellent performances. Nicholas Cage and Jon Mulaney are both perfect. The action is great and it's extremely well paced."
