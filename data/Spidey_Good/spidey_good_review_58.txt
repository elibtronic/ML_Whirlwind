"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his adult nephew. We all were enthralled by the tale of the various Spider-Heroes depicted in this film especially the main one of Miles Morales. Some of the backgrounds looked like what a 3-D movie would look like without wearing the glasses which confused me to think I needed them but then the front scenes were clear so I then knew I didn't. Great visuals and story. Also, nice extended cameo by co-creator Stan Lee and touching since this was released after his passing. Nice of the credits sequence to also dedicate the movie in memory of him and other co-creator Steve Ditko. So that's a very high recommendation of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."
