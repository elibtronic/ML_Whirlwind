Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is easily the best superhero film of 2018 and its place as the 2nd best Marvel film to date is unlikely to be unseated by anything else. It's a must see for anyone with even a remote love for the character and it completely makes up for the terrible depictions of Spider-Man in both Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's nice to see my faith (Or, relative faith over Marvel studios, at least) rewarded."
