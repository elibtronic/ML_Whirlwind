Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman & writer Phil Lord, have given us the best big screen adaptation of Spider-Man & that's saying something. I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively. Kathryn Hahn & Liev Schreiber are superb as Doc Ock & Wilson Fisk, respectively. Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Velez, Zoe Kravitz & Chris Pine are great as Aunt May, Rio Morales, Mary Jane & Peter Parker, respectively. Everything about Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is jaw-dropping! A must watch. Swing by your nearest multiplex, immediately!"
