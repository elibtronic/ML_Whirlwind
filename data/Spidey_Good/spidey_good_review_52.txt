"I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. It deserves any and all awards and kudos it will surely garner."
