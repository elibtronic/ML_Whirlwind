"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen and possibly the best looking superhero movie of all time; with its bright neon colors combined with its comic book asthetic, it creates a world unlike anything I've seen since the LEGO Movie. The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people. The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping. It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee. This is the best Spider-Man movie by far."
