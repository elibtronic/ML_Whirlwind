All the people from different Spider-verses are likeable and hilarious, every scene could be made into a poster because of how aesthetically pleasing the entire movie is. The background stories for each time we are introduced to a new spider-person are excellently done and the villains are also done really well. This is a rare example of superhero movie perfection."
