Don't be fooled, this cartoon was made to be to be viewed in IMAX 3D! The 2D conversion made & released by Sony studios is TERRIBLE & a joke. This is just like the story of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" or as a used car salesman spiel. They worked 4 years on the 3D release & on a blurry mess of a miss-conversion 2D release.
