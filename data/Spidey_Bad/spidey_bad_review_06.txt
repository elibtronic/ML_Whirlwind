Terrible music. Entirely unnecessary, useless and annoying music. Ruined the movie. Average movie overall, and incredibly overrated. The worthless and mindless music started blarring at least 10-15 times throughout the film. Very shallow and annoying rap nonsense. Can't deal with it. I have never seen a movie with less fitting music.

Way to many spider "men", including unbelieveably cheesy and annoying unfitting representations of the character.

It was just a super cheesy movie, and it was entirely unneeded and directionless.
