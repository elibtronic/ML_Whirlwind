I'll admit 1/10 is a harsh, I'd actually give it a 6.5 or 7, I was only trying to level things out. It's just unfair that this is going to be remembered as one of the top 20 films in history because of uneducated raters who find Blade Runner:2049 confusing, but think Spiderman is ""the best movie ever cos of awesome fight scenes and tonnes of action"".
