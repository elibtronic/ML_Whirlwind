But back to the movie itself into the spider verse features not 1 but 5 rip-off spider-men. You have the rip-off Spider-man whom the movie is about Miles Morales, who is just a black Spider-man and an unlikable boring version of Peter Parker whose only feature that separates him from Peter Parker is that he's black. Not half as deeply flawed or interesting as Peter Parker he's not a nerd who gets picked on he doesn't have trouble talking to girls he's not someone that people can relate to he's boring he's pointless and most of all he's not Spider-Man.
