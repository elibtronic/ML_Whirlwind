Then they bring in even worse, Spider man clones you have a stupid, unfunny talking pig who is a joke character made for idiots in the 80's. Then you have a generic anime girl with a pet robot who's also somehow a spider even less of a character just a generic backstory. Then you have another gimmick spider-man who's black and white and wears a hat and goggles basically a lame version of Gotham by gaslight batman which is ironic since batman beyond first ripped of Spider man 2099 which should've been in this movie instead of the stupid anime girl. They also threw in another pointless spider-man-man rip-off Spider-Gwen who has the stupidest name of any superhero just create an original character instead of making a bad spider-man clone you talent-less lazy hacks at marvel.
