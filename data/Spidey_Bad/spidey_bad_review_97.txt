"Yeah they put a lot of money into it picture wise and hired a great cast. But it's the same idea from the Flash TV show different dimensions or worlds of the same character. I gave it a shot as a Spiderman fan but it doesn't do it for me. Spider Gwen? What the hell..really? And that hood out fit with the shorts was lame and ghetto for a super hero. Bonus powers? yeah, I don't think so buddy. This movie is for little kids but not hard core Spider-man fans. I'm sure they're going to start doing this with other characters now, Yeah no, that's really stupid. This whole concept was stolen from The Flash with a marvel spin to it. I didn't even like how crusty Peter Parker was looking in this cartoon either."
