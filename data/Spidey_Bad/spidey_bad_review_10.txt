All the hype is just liberals trying to sell their "diversity" vision as usual. The movie is rather boring, rather annoying with it's cheesy, flashy, constantly moving (rapidly) abstract shapes in the background, like your average Japanese anime. The storyline is ""meh"", the length too long.

It's meant to be more of a social-political statement than anything else. Quality and entertainment wise it's Saturday morning kid cartoon at best.
