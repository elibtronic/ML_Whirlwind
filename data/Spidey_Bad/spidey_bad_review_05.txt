Although storylines are predictable, I love spiderman movies. I like spiderman as a vigilante. He is smart, funny and brave and these are all traits you will look for in a superhero. But this Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse movie disappointed me very much. In fact, I would not call it a 'movie'. Its a more of a youtube video I would say. The inconsistent script, character popping up here and there like a popcorn. Total waste of 1h 57min of my life.
