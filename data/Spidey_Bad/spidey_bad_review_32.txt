"Uninspiring story with mediocre dialogue and lots of cliche and chance encounters make for a pretty dull movie. The awe-inspiring cgi fails to make up for its many shortcomings. I would rate it a 5 on my personal scale, but seeing as so many people (or bots??) have given it a 10, I intentionally rate it down with a 1. For me it was a waste of time and money and would not recommend to anyone. Worst Spiderman movie I ever saw."
