Don't make a spider-man movie and not make it about Spider-man that is just idiotic instead they made this movie about discount Spider-man and then gave him a similar tragic backstory, but dumber and then have said discount recolored Spider-Man saves the day and defeats the cartoony looking villain and stops the cliche doomsday plot device."
