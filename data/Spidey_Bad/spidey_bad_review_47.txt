"If this movie is for the kids, I doubt if any of them will even understand the plot and the purported humor. They tried to complicate the plot too much. So it is the adults who are going ga ga over a kids movie. So much for the purpose. But who cares when the box office cash is flowing. I found the plot to be mushed and too complicated. The animation seemed blurred in many places. I dont know if that was the intention. And the 3D effects are nothing to rave about. Very Ordinary.There are far better 3D animation movies out there and I wont rate this in the list of Top-10 3D animated movies.."
