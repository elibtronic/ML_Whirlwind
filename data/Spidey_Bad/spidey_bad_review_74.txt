The one thing that ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" had working for it, was the animation style and the art style, which was very reminiscent of the Borderlands games and the Telltale interactive games. But that was also just about all that was working in favor of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" in my opinion.
