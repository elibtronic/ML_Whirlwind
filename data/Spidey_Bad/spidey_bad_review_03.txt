What nonsense did I actually watch, same story, same villain, just bringing up extra 5 spider-men doesn't change anything, the origin story of Miles should have been better, creative not something that people can easily find in the comics! What was the difference? Lame radioactive spiders roaming around, biting people turning them into spiders! The entire world will turn into spiders then! Guys you completely lost it, the millions that were used should have been saved for some better origin stories! What a waste of time and money! Definitely requires a refund for this! Completely ruined my 2 hours! A bit of respect I had for spider-man film is completely destroyed.
