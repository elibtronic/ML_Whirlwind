I was so excited to watch this movie..heard so much hype..it was totally disappointing..This is the worst spider-man movie ever..After seeing all those swirly colors- i literally dozed off for a while...so better i would stick to homecoming & far from home. Into the Spider-Verse was nice concept but bad cinematography..No sequel please
