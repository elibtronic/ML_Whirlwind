"I am not a fan of animated movies, but I like and follow marvel movies. Movie starts very gently with lots of passionate scenes, especially when the dad-cop asked his son to reply ""Dad, I love you."" This movie followed the disappointing formula, in which a movie starts off well, but then it's all downhill from there. After that scene, all of a sudden, the movie became so confusing and the story line got so slop as it was filled with many unreasonable and superfluous actions, And once again, I was left constantly wondering when this movie would end. I didn't leave early, because I did not want to disturb the other people, if there were any left."
