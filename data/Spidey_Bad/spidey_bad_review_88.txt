Let's be honest; The story majorly lacked character development. An unavoidable fault however, as the audience raving about it are the same people who can't sit through a 2hr+ film without pulling out their phones and branding it ""boring"". The plot concept was fun and very interesting, but execution was mediocre at best. You could predict the entire film from watching the trailer to be honest. A lack of development in to key events made the majority of the watch emotionless. Huge opportunities like the passing of Fisk's wife, or the fact that all the alternate Spidermen could disintegrate; were brushed over. Though not exactly a Hans Zimmer masterpiece, the sound was okay. The picture also wasn't to my taste, however I appreciate the creativity and intention.
