"This isnt the Spiderman I grew up watching. But as I see the current trend in Hollywood is to take the leading white male characters from successful movies of the past like Ghostbusters, James bond, Men in Black, Oceans series and turn them into either women, black or gray in the new movie. Into the spiderverse followed the same politically correct and turned Spiderman into every possible race, gender and animal on the planet. The question is is it really necessary? If you want to empower certain section of the society make new, good movies about them, but you can't. So you take the successful characters and turn them into black or female, even though it bombed so many times at the box office already. I hated the little kid spideman. Spiderman to me is a man, not a pig, not a girl and not a little black kid. Worst Spiderman movie ever.
