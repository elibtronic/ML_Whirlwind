This movie had some good moments and some funny moments, but overall, it's a below average animation for children. A lot of people are praising the art style, but personally it actually strained my eyes after 30 minutes, and I'm only in my twenties. The low frame rate and sometimes just bad picure quality make me feel like I'm watching a bad video game cutscene.
