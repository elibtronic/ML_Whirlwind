"Contains light spoilers! 8.7 on Imdb? Are you for real? I couldn't even watch it till the end, i had to stop. After I saw DV.A spiderman and Spider Pig, that was too much! I mean the story is not so bad, kind of interesting actually, but then it turns into this laughable, ridiculous childrens cartoon, something you could show on a saturday morning for the little ones to enjoy. but if you're looking for something meaningful, look somewhere else, because you won't find it here."
