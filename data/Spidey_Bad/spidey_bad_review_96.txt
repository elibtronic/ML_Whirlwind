"If spiderman into the spiderverse wins, the academy will officially have fallen as low as they possibly can. It is ridiculous how marvel and producers are so greedy to even think about making a completely new movie about a character which is popular at the moment. The spiderman homecoming series hasn't even ended and they're already working on new projects about the same character. It just causes confusion and in my case disappointment. This is why the amazing spiderman series never got a final end. Sure, spiderman homecoming hit the box office quite good... but was it seriously necessary to do a movie with thousands of spidermen just to take advantage of the popularity the character has? I've always disliked marvel because of their lack of passion for filmmaking. They do huge budget movies every year which only take about 6 months too complete just for money. All the movies follow the same plotline. None of them are original. Its just remakes and sequels, one after another. Spiderman into the spiderverse has been the most ridiculous project so far."
