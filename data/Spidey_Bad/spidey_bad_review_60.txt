Miles Morales basically steals Peter Parker's origin story by having his uncle die and rips off the ending of Sam Raimi Spider-man by will his father thinks Spider-Man killed his brother. Green Goblin and the other regular spider-man villains look idiotic if something isn't broken don't fix it as they made it worse in this case. The Kingpin also doesn't even look human he looks like a golem or slightly uglier Ben Grimm and they forgot to add his neck as he doesn't even have a hint of neck the kingpin isn't a cartoon monster he's a human a fat human, but a human a human who murders a lot people for greed not nonetheless and not terrible cartoon character.
