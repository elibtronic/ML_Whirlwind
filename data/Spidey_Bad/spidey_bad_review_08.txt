I'm a lifelong Spider-Man fan, and this is probably the worst venture of the whole series. I lost interested w/in about 15, 20 minutes.

Nobody wants Miles Morales as the primary Spider-Man, but that's not even the reason this was so bad. It was just... STUPID. The 1970's TV movie w Nicholas Hammond was better.

Plus, the entire story was already played out on TV (Ultimate Spider-Man?). It was just an unnecessary, unwanted, and poorly executed venture.
