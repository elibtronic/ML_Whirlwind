"I am absolutely shocked at the massively high rating and hype surrounding this movie. I'm afraid it's a victim of Black Panther syndrome, which judges a motion picture on inclusivity rather than actual quality. This is also reflected pretty obviously in the soundtrack which is obnoxious hip hop, which is of course just my opinion.
