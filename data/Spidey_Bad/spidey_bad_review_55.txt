"Apparently, the background in much of this movie is comic book pages which were printed with the blue and red inks not quite matching up. That made them ""fuzzy"". I found this very distracting, and by the time I had finished the movie, I was worn out. Also, there were endless chase scenes and endless superpowered- characters throwing other superpowered-characters around. The usual stuff, which I find silly. And it was long. And loud. I guess this entire genre is targeted at children. I found nothing interesting in this movie."
